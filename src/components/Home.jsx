        I am a passionate Node.js developer, always eager to learn new things.

        Here, you’ll find personal information, examples of my projects, and a

      <p className="mb-3">
        My life was dedicated to professional sports. I have been playing
        basketball since I was 7 years old. What started as a childhood hobby
        grew into a profession that gave me the opportunity to explore the
        world, meet incredible people, and undoubtedly shaped me into a strong
        person both mentally and physically.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        However, I knew that such great things aren’t meant to last forever, so
        I always made sure to prioritize my education throughout those years.
        Having finished school successfully, I wanted to pursue a degree in
        computer science, but my parents chose another field, believing it was
        not a &apos;serious&apos; profession at the time. Despite this, the
        desire to become a software engineer never left me.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        Now, as my career as a professional athlete comes to an end, I am
        determined to become a professional software engineer. It is not an easy
        walk these days, especially when many fear that AI will replace
        developers in the near future.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        But I firmly believe that a good software engineer cannot be replaced by
        a machine, no matter how powerful it may be.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 font-semibold">
        After all, software engineering is much more than just writing code...
